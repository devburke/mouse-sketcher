This project is a challenge to practice Javascript (and maybe jQuery) skills.

Credit to [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav) for the idea.

Also credit to [dfan14051](https://github.com/dfan14051/sketchpad) for some improvements I made to how this worked. It was fully functional before, but the grid was drawn with simple \<br/>s between each row. Using \<div>s for rows makes for a much better DOM structure.
